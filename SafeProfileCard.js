{/**When building user interfaces, we often have to deal with incomplete or nested data.
Write a function generateProfileCard that takes a user object and returns a formatted profile string in the following format:
"{name} | {city} | followers: {followers}"

Fallback Rules
If certain fields are missing (null or undefined), use these fallbacks:

name: defaults to "Anonymous"
address.city: defaults to "Unknown"
social.followers: defaults to 0
Important: Empty strings "" and the number 0 are valid values and must not be replaced by fallbacks. Use optional chaining (?.) and the nullish coalescing operator (??) to handle this safely.

Examples
generateProfileCard({
  name: "Rafi",
  address: { city: "Dhaka" },
  social: { followers: 0 }
});
// Returns: "Rafi | Dhaka | followers: 0"

generateProfileCard({
  name: "Alice",
  social: { followers: 120 }
});
// Returns: "Alice | Unknown | followers: 120"

Example 1
Input: user = {"address":{"city":"Dhaka"},"name":"Rafi","social":{"followers":0}}
Output: "Rafi | Dhaka | followers: 0"

Example 2
Input: user = {"name":"Alice","social":{"followers":120}}
Output: "Alice | Unknown | followers: 120"

Example 3
Input: user = {}
Output: "Anonymous | Unknown | followers: 0"

Example 4
Input: user = {"address":{"city":""},"name":"","social":{"followers":999}}
Output: " |  | followers: 999"

Example 5
Input: user = {"address":{"city":null},"name":null,"social":{"followers":null}}
Output: "Anonymous | Unknown | followers: 0"

Example 6
Input: user = {"address":{},"name":"Bob","social":{}}
Output: "Bob | Unknown | followers: 0"

Example 7
Input: user = {"address":{"city":"London"},"name":"Charlie"}
Output: "Charlie | London | followers: 0"

Constraints
The input is always an object, though its properties may be missing, null, or undefined. */}

function generateProfileCard(user) {

  const name = user?.name ?? "Anonymous";
  const city = user?.address?.city ?? "Unknown";
  const followers = user?.social?.followers ?? 0;

  return `${name} | ${city} | followers: ${followers}`;
}
