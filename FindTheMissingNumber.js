{/**Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Examples
missingNumber([3, 0, 1]);
// => 2

missingNumber([0, 1]);
// => 2

Example 1
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers. The range is [0, 3]. 2 is missing.

Example 2
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers. The range is [0, 2]. 2 is missing.

Constraints
n === nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique. */}

function missingNumber(nums) {
 
  const n = nums.length;
  const expectedSum = n*(n+1)/2;
  const actualSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num , 0);

  return expectedSum - actualSum;
